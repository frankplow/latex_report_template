\section*{Plagiarism in University Assessments and the Presentation of Fraudulent or Fabricated Coursework}
\emph{Plagiarism} is defined as presenting someone elseâ€™s work as your own. Work means any intellectual output, and typically includes text, data, images, sound or performance.

\emph{Fraudulent or fabricated coursework} is defined as work, particularly reports of laboratory or practical work that is untrue and/or made up, submitted to satisfy the requirements of a University assessment, in whole or in part.

\section*{Declaration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I have read the University Regulations on Plagiarism and state that the work covered by this declaration is my own and does not contain any unacknowledged work from other sources.
    \item I confirm my consent to the University copying and distributing any or all of my work in any form and using third parties (who may be based outside the EU/EEA) to monitor breaches of regulations, to verify whether my work contains plagiarised material, and for quality assurance purposes.
    \item I confirm that details of any mitigating circumstances or other matters which might have affected my performance and which I wish to bring to the attention of the examiners, have been submitted to the Student Support Office.
\end{itemize}
